      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a object that stores multiple values of data in a single variable. Each of these values can be accessed through an index.</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming?</li>
      <p>Hardcoding means manually typing out multiple values into the code, instead of generating them with the code.</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In part 3, we take text, and force them to become independent values in an array. Then we put that array into a loop, for it to figure out what the length of the array is. After this we can easily access each of the elements individually. </p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Storing instances inside of an array allows the coder to manage multiple object efficiently, be able to use operations on individual objects and organize the data in a better way.</p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and"Thursday", how would it ideally look?</li>
      <p>The object "EWeekDays" represents the days of the week, and includes the value and the name of the day. They days are categorized separately, but also as "Weekdays" and "Weekend". To categorize them together the object uses the days' values.  </p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>A callback in sorting is a function the coder provides, that tells the array how to compare two elements. The function gets two elements, and based on the results, the array decides the order. </p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print both parameters each time the sorting routine runs</li>
      <p>The function compares two elements at a time. If the function returns a negative value, one number goes before the other. It does this for all the numbers, until there is a clear order.</p>
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.</li>
      <p>The first element of the array is an array that represents the first row. Each element in that array contains elements showing the row and column.</p>
