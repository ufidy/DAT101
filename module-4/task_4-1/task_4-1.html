      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Using objects is a way to keep the code more organized and scalable. It helps since when you declare the important information once, you don't have to keep declaring it for every task.</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>We create it for later use in the tasks. It is meant to contain important information and making coding later easier. For example, in the code we need to establish pension and savings accounts. This is made easier by using the fixed list, instead of repeating the information multiple times.</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Hiding code in classes is easier to maintain overall. It also prevents other parts of the program from depending on the code.</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>It creates an empty object, and links it to the constructors prototype.</p>
