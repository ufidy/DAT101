      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake-up time is not exactly 7, then the code follows the "else" statement and outputs a different message than it would if the wake-uo time was exactly 7.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Since we added an "else if" statement, now if the wake-up time was 8, the "else if" program would print out "I can take the train to school". If the time is exactly 7 then the program would print out "I can take the bus to school". </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>In part 3, we add the "else" statement , which makes it so that when the time is anything besides 7 or 8, the program prints out "i can take the car to school". </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>In part 4, if we write the number 0, the program will print out "zero", since 0 is not a negative or a positive number. </p>
