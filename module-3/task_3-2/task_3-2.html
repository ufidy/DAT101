          <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes, you can use a for loop for it. Its even better to use the for loop, as its a shorter command and more understandable.]</p>
          <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop? Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
your answer.]</li>
      <p>[Yes you can. The while loop can run infinitely, as long as the code does not have a condition regarding the ending.]</p>
          <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[A computer might be overloaded if a while loop does not have a condition regarding its ending. This is because the while loop will roll forever unstopped. The program can run tasks outside of the while loop without a problem.] </p>
          <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, hange the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?]</li>
